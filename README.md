# Mental-Health-Data-Analysis-
This analysis uses data from the NHIS annual survey to analyze the number of people who say they would like to see a mental health professional but claim they cannot afford one. The analysis takes into account income, health insurance, mental health, and the passage of the Affordable Care Act. 

After lots of cleaning and EDA, logistic regression ultimately shows that:
1.  people with higher incomes are more likely to be able to afford mental health care
2.  people with better mental health are more likely to afford mental health care
3.  people were more likley to afford mental health care after the passage of the ACA

Menta health is measured by the k6 score, more information about this score can be found here: https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/k6_scales.php
